The arch-guide repository is aimed at helping new Arch Linux users get better acquainted with the new system - it provides tips and tricks for using it, links to other useful resources, customizing the look and feel, and more. The repository will be added to over time as we work on it, but you are also welcome to submit ideas and edits. Also, if you don't have anywhere to spend your money, you can donate it so I'll be more willing to expand it.
